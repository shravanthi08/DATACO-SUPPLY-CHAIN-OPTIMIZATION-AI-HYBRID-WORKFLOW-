# 📑 Project Report — DataCo Supply Chain Optimization Project

---

## 🔹 Project Overview
The **DataCo Supply Chain Optimization Project** demonstrates an end‑to‑end workflow combining **GenAI prompts** with **Python validation** and **Tableau dashboards**.  
The goal is to optimize supply chain operations, reduce costs, and generate recruiter‑friendly insights through a hybrid AI + human validation approach.

---

## 🔹 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the DataCo dataset for analysis.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and inefficiencies.  
- Build an **optimization model** to minimize shipping costs while meeting demand.  
- Simulate **business scenarios** (demand spike, supplier delay, cost increase).  
- Create a **Tableau dashboard** for recruiter‑friendly storytelling.  
- Document the entire workflow for reproducibility and portfolio polish.

## 🔹 Dataset
- Source: [DataCo Supply Chain Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yogape/logistics-operations-database)  
- Raw dataset: 53 columns with detailed logistics operations.  
- Cleaned dataset: Reduced to ~10 essential fields for clarity and recruiter impact.  
- Key derived field: `shipping_delay` (difference between order date and ship date).

## 🔹 Methodology & Workflow
```markdown
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
   - Loaded raw dataset from Kaggle.
   - Removed duplicates and missing values.
   - Standardized cost and profit fields.
   - Created derived field `shipping_delay`.
   - Saved cleaned dataset for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Profit trends (line chart).
   - Shipping delays by country (heatmap).
   - Cost vs sales (scatter plot).
   - Top customers by sales (bar chart).
   - Profit margin distribution (box plot).
   - Generated recruiter‑friendly insights.

3. Optimization Modeling
   - Built PuLP optimization model.
   - Objective: minimize shipping costs.
   - Constraints: demand fulfillment and deadlines.
   - Output: optimized shipping quantities and total cost.

4. Scenario Simulation
   - Demand spike (+20%).
   - Supplier delay (+5 days).
   - Cost increase (+15%).
   - Recalculated shipping quantities and costs.
   - Demonstrated adaptability of the model.

5. Visualization & Dashboard
   - Exported charts and summary tables.
   - Built Tableau dashboard with KPI cards and filters.
   - Integrated visuals for recruiter storytelling.

6. Business Insights
   - Seasonal profit peaks identified.
   - Shipping delays concentrated in specific regions.
   - High‑value customers drive majority of revenue.
   - Cost inefficiencies detected in certain categories.
   - Optimization model adapts to demand, delay, and cost scenarios.
