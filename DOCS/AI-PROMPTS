Step‑by‑Step Hybrid Workflow (Notebook + AI Assistant) AI PROMPTS
Step 1: Project Setup.
Step 2: Data Understanding & Column Selection.
2.1 Inspect the Dataset.
AI Prompt :  
"List all columns in the DataCo dataset and categorize them into: 
(a) identifiers, (b) transactional fields, (c) supply chain metrics, (d) customer/location fields."
2.2 Suggest Reduced Schema.
AI Prompt :
“Identify the most relevant columns for supply chain optimization 
(cost, profit, shipping delays, customer location). Suggest a reduced 
schema of 8–10 columns.”
Step 3 — Data Cleaning.
AI Prompt :
“Clean the DataCoSupplyChain_Clean dataset by:
1.Handling missing values in key columns (order_date, ship_date, cost, profit, sales, qty).
2.Removing duplicate rows.
3.Standardizing cost and profit units.
4.Creating a new column for shipping_delay = ship_date – order_date.”
Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
AI Prompt 1 (Profit by Product Category) :
“Summarize total profit by product category and suggest a visualization that highlights
the most profitable categories.”
AI Prompt 2 (Shipping Delays by Country) :
“Calculate average shipping delays by customer country and suggest a visualization to compare regions.”
AI Prompt 3 (Cost Distribution) :
“Analyze the distribution of cost values and suggest a visualization to detect outliers or skewness.”
Step 5: Optimization Modeling.
AI Prompt
“Formulate a supply chain optimization problem using the cleaned DataCo dataset.
Objective: minimize total shipping cost while meeting product demand and delivery deadlines.
Constraints:
Demand must be satisfied for each product category.
Shipping delays must not exceed acceptable thresholds.
Profit should remain positive.”
Step 6: Scenario Simulation.
AI Prompt 1 (Demand Spike Scenario) :
“Simulate a scenario where product demand increases by 20% across all categories.
Recalculate shipping quantities and costs under this new demand.”
AI Prompt 2 (Supplier Delay Scenario) :
“Simulate a scenario where shipping delays increase by 5 days in certain countries.
Recalculate average delays and identify regions most affected.”
AI Prompt 3 (Cost Fluctuation Scenario)
“Simulate a scenario where supplier costs increase by 15% across all product categories.
Recalculate shipping quantities and total cost under this new cost structure.”
Step 7: Visualization & Dashboarding.
AI Prompt 1 (Profit Trends Over Time) :
“Create a line chart showing profit trends over time (monthly or quarterly) to highlight seasonal patterns.”
AI Prompt 2 (Shipping Delay Heatmap) :
“Create a heatmap of average shipping delays by country to visualize regional bottlenecks.”
AI Prompt 3 (Cost vs. Sales Comparison) :
“Create a scatter plot comparing cost vs. sales to detect efficiency patterns and outliers.”
AI Prompt 4 (Top Customers by Sales) :
“Create a bar chart showing the top 10 customers ranked by total sales to highlight key accounts.”
AI Prompt 5 (Profit Margin Analysis) :
“Create a box plot of profit margins across product categories to detect variability and outliers.”
Step 8: Dashboard Integration (Tableau).
AI Prompt 1 (Dashboard Layout) :
“Design a Tableau dashboard that integrates the following visuals:
1. Line chart of monthly profit trends
2. Heatmap of shipping delays by country
3. Scatter plot of cost vs. sales
4. Bar chart of top 10 customers by sales
5. Box plot of profit margins by product category
Arrange them into a recruiter‑friendly layout with filters for product category and country.”
AI Prompt 2 (Interactivity & Filters) :
“Add interactive filters to the Tableau dashboard for:
Product category
Customer country
Date range
Ensure that all charts update dynamically when filters are applied.”
AI Prompt 3 (Storytelling & Branding) :
“Format the Tableau dashboard with:
Clear titles (e.g., ‘Supply Chain Optimization Insights’)
Consistent color palette (blue for profit, red for delays, green for sales)
KPI cards at the top showing total profit, average delay, and total sales
Make the dashboard recruiter‑friendly and visually polished.”
